#Handwritten Music Notes Recognition

Description

This project implements a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten music notes using the VGG19 convolutional neural network architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten music notes and leverages a single dense layer with 64 neurons for classification. The project is deployed on GitHub for easy access and potential collaboration.

Key Features

VGG19-based Model: Employs the powerful VGG19 architecture for feature extraction from handwritten music notes.
Dense Layer (64 Neurons): Utilizes a single dense layer with 64 neurons for effective classification of music notes.
GitHub Deployment: Enables easy access to the project code and potential contributions from the community.
